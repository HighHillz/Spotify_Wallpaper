## How to Run
- First of all, ensure that the latest version of Node.js (LTS) has been installed.
- Make sure to activate live server first. That can be done by running the HTML from the editor.
- To start the application, run the following command on your command prompt/terminal from the project repo.
```bash
node server.js
```
- Click on the link provided on the output (You may close the terminal after this).
- Make sure Spotify is running on your desktop.
- **Note:** Token expires after an hour after running the command. To refresh it, re-run the node command and click on the link.

## Inspiration
Whenever I listened to songs on Spotify, I had always wanted to know the details of the song including its release data because it talks a lot about a song. Moreover, each song has its own tone. A colour would help bringing that out. Sometimes, its the most dominant colour of the album picture, or it changes by mood.

That was when I realised I can build a super cool wallpaper thats admirable like the Sky wallpaper, but room for more interaction and peace.
