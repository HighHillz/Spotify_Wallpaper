## How to Run
- First of all, ensure that the latest version of Node.js (LTS) has been installed.
- Make sure to activate live server first. That can be done by running the HTML from the editor.
- To start the application, run the following command on your command prompt/terminal from the project repo.
```bash
node server.js
```
- Click on the link provided on the output (You may close the terminal after this).
- Make sure Spotify is running on your desktop.
- **Note:** Token expires after an hour after running the command. To refresh it, re-run the node command and click on the link.
